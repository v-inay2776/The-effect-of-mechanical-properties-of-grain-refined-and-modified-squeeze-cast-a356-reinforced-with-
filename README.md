Aluminium-Silicon composite possess light weight, high specific strength and good heat transfer ability which make them suitable material to replace components made of ferrous alloys. Al-Si alloys are widely used in all types of IC engines such as cylinder blocks, cylinder heads and Pistons.   Comprehensive literature survey has been carried out covering published literature on materials, methods, processing of Al-Si alloys, evaluation of mechanical properties. Based on literature survey, (A356.0) was selected for the study.   In view of the above project is aimed to develop a composite through Squeeze casting Technique, where A356.0 is reinforced with dual Silicon carbide. Castings with varied properties of reinforcing elements are obtained. The specimens obtained as per standard norms were standard for Microstructure and Mechanical properties. The results of composites were compared with As-cast specimen.  Microstructure consists of interdendritic precipitates in matrix of aluminium solid casting. Casting S5 gives the better hardness and tensile strength compared to AS cast and other casting. So S5 can be used for future work.
